see what the other errors are... 

oversteer (angle too great)

over driver torque

over LKAS torque --- FOUND... 1011 bits 



--. added if's for sending the CAN line data.  DONE 210308

1. shift steer status  
        eps laks disabled
    over 2 to the MSB.
    AND
    put 
        can steer counter error
        can steer counter fatal
    to the last byte at the 2 most MSB making a 4 bit hole


2. put the 4 'unknown bits'  at the new hole at B2 O0-O3

3. change the DBC as stated above.

4. maybe remove EPS_LKAS_DISABLED

5. remove wiggle bit... OP should do this

6. mod the OP code to work as i want it to...
