not sure where i put the other 'notes'

regarding the 'steer_status' bits found in the EPStoLKAS
 
mlocoteta tested on 210304 by allowing 250/251 to be sent on steer_torque.  previously we set the max at 240. which allowed 241 due to wiggle bit in LIN board code 
    (since removed as OP should do this).  After 6 frames over 241, EPS errored and stopped applying torque.
    the following bits went from 0 to 1:
        EPS B0O4
        EPS B2O0
        EPS B2O1


LKAS unk signal 2 stays on for 11 frames .. off for 27 then both Singal 1 and 2 go high for 2 frames w LKAS_ENABLED

when goin goff .4 seconds later (40 frames?) Signal1 and 2 stay high with lkas active for 5 frames
then only signal 2 stays high for 6 frames
